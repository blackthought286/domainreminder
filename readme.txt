Simple plugin that allows a user to remind them when the blog's domain is about to expire

== Description ==

This is a a simple plugin that is used for setting a reminder of when your domain is going to expire. You set the
date once and it will display it in the panel. This is only the first version and we will be looking to expand some
of the features available. 

This includes:

- A countdown that will give you a ten and then a five day reminder
- A smoother look
